# 🛡️ EXAM LOCKDOWN
**Engineered by Quantazeroplus**

### 🌟 Vision
A next-generation, lightweight kiosk architecture designed for **Government Engineering College, West Champaran**. This system redefines academic integrity by temporarily reshaping the Windows environment into a dedicated, unhackable examination terminal. No unauthorized files, no desktop distractions—just the exam.



### 🚀 Innovation Highlights
* **Total Shell Immersion:** Seamlessly bypasses the standard Windows interface to eliminate Taskbar and Start Menu interference.
* **Smart Path Resolution:** Advanced registry-based logic ensures perfect deployment on any hardware configuration, including cloud-synced OneDrive environments.
* **Safe-Stream Viewing:** High-security rendering forces exam content to stay within the browser, neutralizing download and "Save As" exploits.
* **Persistent Rule-Overlay:** A background instruction layer that remains anchored, ensuring students always have access to exam protocols.
* **Vault Technology:** Integrated utility to create hidden, fortified directories for administrative file protection.
* **Administrative Recovery:** An intelligent session-restore loop that only hands back control after authorized administrative validation.
* **Ghost Protocol:** Automated self-removal architecture that leaves zero footprint on the student machine post-examination.

### 📖 The Workflow

1.  **Orchestration:** Run the setup utility to generate the secure deployment module.
2.  **Activation:** Deploy the module on student terminals to trigger the kiosk environment.
3.  **Data Security:** Utilize the integrated vault tool to safeguard sensitive administrative documents.
4.  **Student Protocol:**
    * Focus remains strictly on Paper/OMR submission.
    * System rules remain accessible via standard navigation shortcuts.
    * Session termination triggers a mandatory administrative authorization screen.
